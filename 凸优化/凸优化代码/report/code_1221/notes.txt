其他的flop
1. The computation of the Frobenius norm is very easy: it requires about nm flops.
2. The computation of the largest singular value norm of a matrix is not as easy as with the Frobenius norm. Hovewer, it can be computed with linear algebra methods seen here, in about min(n,m)nm flops.


TCC
TCC between two matrices: the sum of their canonical correlations as defined in Lemma 1.1
TCC(A,B) = sum ( A和B的canonical correlations )
